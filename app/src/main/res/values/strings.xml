        We\'re going to play a game for your birthday.\n
        Basically this app has a series of scavenger hunt locations, each with a four digit code.\n
        When you find the code, type it into the text box below the prompt.\n\n
        Oh, and if you get stuck, each prompt has a couple hints.\n
        Don\'t be a bitch tho. I\'ll know how many you used. \n
        Love you, have fun!\n\n
        PS: I know this app is uglier than sin. I tried tho :)
